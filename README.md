Machine learning system for detecting account-takeover fraud in mobile money
transactions, built on the Financial simulated transaction dataset. Trained and
compared four classifiers — SGD, Logistic Regression, LightGBM, and XGBoost —
to flag fraudulent TRANSFER and CASH_OUT transactions in real time, with the
long-term goal of evolving this into a full production fraud detection
platform.

## Problem Statement

Mobile money platforms are increasingly vulnerable to fraudulent transactions, particularly account-takeover attacks. Due to the private nature of financial data, publicly available datasets are scarce. This project uses the *PaySim* synthetic dataset, which simulates real-world mobile money transactions, to develop a machine learning model that accurately distinguishes fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones in a highly imbalanced dataset.

Empirical analysis of the full dataset *(6 Millions transactions)* confirms fraud
is structurally confined to these two transaction types:

| Type      | Transactions | Fraud cases | Fraud rate |
|-----------|-------------:|------------:|-----------:|
| CASH_IN   | 1,399,284    | 0           | 0.00%      |
| DEBIT     | 41,432       | 0           | 0.00%      |
| PAYMENT   | 2,151,495    | 0           | 0.00%      |
| TRANSFER  | 532,909      | 4,097       | 0.77%      |
| CASH_OUT  | 2,237,500    | 4,116       | 0.18%      |

No fraud occurs in CASH_IN, DEBIT, or PAYMENT transactions, and all destination
accounts in the TRANSFER/CASH_OUT population are verified customer accounts —
the merchant-related data quality artifacts present in the full dataset
(untracked balances) do not affect this modeling population. The existing
rule-based control (isFlaggedFraud, which flags single transfers over
200,000) fails to catch the vast majority of fraud, which frequently occurs at
much smaller amounts.

## Goal

Build a binary classification model to detect fraudulent *TRANSFER* and *CASH_OUT* transactions before funds leave the system. The objective is to maximize fraud detection *(high Recall)* while maintaining acceptable *Precision, using **Precision–Recall AUC* as the primary evaluation metric.

*Success criteria:*
- Maximize recall (fraud catch rate) at an acceptable precision threshold,
  given the cost asymmetry between missed fraud and false holds
- Primary metric: Precision-Recall AUC (not accuracy, given ~0.3% fraud
  prevalence in the scoped population)
- Report performance in business terms: *"At X% precision, the model catches
  Y% of fraudulent transactions"*

## Approach

1. *Scoping* — filtered to TRANSFER/CASH_OUT only, verified empirically
   rather than assumed (see table above)
2. *EDA* — profiled balance-conservation behavior; identified that fraud
   correlates with an account being fully drained (oldbalanceOrg == amount,
   newbalanceOrig == 0), not with transaction size alone
3. *Feature engineering* — log-transforms, behavioral ratios, and
   balance-conservation checks; full breakdown in
   [Feature Engineering](#feature-engineering) below
4. *Train/test split* — time-based split using step, rather than random,
   to avoid leakage and simulate real deployment conditions
5. *Modeling* — trained and compared SGD, Logistic Regression, LightGBM, and
   XGBoost, with class-imbalance handling evaluated via precision-recall
   metrics rather than accuracy alone

## Feature Engineering

### Transformations

- amount → log_amount
- oldbalanceOrg → log_oldbalanceOrg

Log-transforms reduce the heavy right-skew typical of monetary values, making
these features better behaved for models sensitive to scale.

### Behavioral Features

| Feature | Formula | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| sender_balance_change | oldbalanceOrg − newbalanceOrig | Amount that actually left the origin account |
| receiver_balance_change | newbalanceDest − oldbalanceDest | Amount that actually arrived at the destination |
| amount_sender_ratio | amount / (oldbalanceOrg + 1) | Fraction of the sender's balance moved in this transaction |
| sender_error | oldbalanceOrg − amount − newbalanceOrig | Conservation-of-money check on the origin side (should be ≈0) |
| receiver_error | oldbalanceDest + amount − newbalanceDest | Conservation-of-money check on the destination side (should be ≈0) |
| emptied_account | 1 if newbalanceOrig == 0 else 0 | Flags accounts fully drained by the transaction |
| dest_balance_missing | 1 if oldbalanceDest == 0 and newbalanceDest == 0 else 0 | Flags destination accounts with no tracked balance |

*amount_sender_ratio interpretation:*
- ≈ 0.05 → normal transaction
- ≈ 0.95 → account nearly emptied
- \> 1 → suspicious / inconsistent

### Feature Selection

- *Correlation-based pruning* — removed features with pairwise correlation
  above 0.90 to reduce redundancy before modeling
- *Random Forest feature importance* — used to validate that engineered
  features carry real signal rather than being included on intuition alone

| Feature | Importance |
|---|---:|
| newbalanceOrig | 0.1454 |
| amount_sender_ratio | 0.1394 |
| dest_balance_missing | 0.1333 |
| emptied_account | 0.1098 |
| sender_balance_change | 0.1086 |
| type_CASH_OUT | 0.0454 |
| type_TRANSFER | 0.0453 |
| sender_error | 0.0433 |
| oldbalanceOrg | 0.0389 |
| log_oldbalanceOrg | 0.0342 |
| newbalanceDest | 0.0319 |
| receiver_balance_change | 0.0307 |
| step | 0.0224 |
| receiver_error | 0.0192 |
| amount | 0.0175 |
| oldbalanceDest | 0.0174 |
| log_amount | 0.0173 |
| isFlaggedFraud | 0.0002 |

Five of the top six features by importance are engineered, not raw —
validating the feature engineering approach. Notably, isFlaggedFraud (the
existing rule-based control) ranks last by a wide margin, reinforcing the
problem statement's finding that the current 200,000-threshold rule
contributes almost nothing to fraud detection.

## Model Comparison

| Model                        | Accuracy | Precision | Recall  | F1 Score | ROC-AUC | PR-AUC  |
|-------------------------------|---------:|----------:|--------:|---------:|--------:|--------:|
| Stochastic Gradient Descent   | 97%      | 8%        | 86%     | 0.23       | 0.92    | 0.04    |
| Logistic Regression            | 96.96%   | 8.79%     | 98.54%  | 0.1613   | 0.9963  | 0.11     |
| LightGBM                       | 98.05%   | 12.93%    | 97.44%  | 0.2284   | 0.9775  | 0.1261  |
| *XGBoost (selected)*         | *99.99%* | *98.26%* | *99.70%* | *0.9897* | *0.9984* | *0.9979* |

*Why XGBoost was selected:* Every baseline — SGD, Logistic Regression, and
LightGBM — reaches respectable accuracy (96–98%) and, on paper, workable
recall (86–98%). PR-AUC is what exposes the real gap: SGD collapses to 0.04
and LightGBM to 0.1261, both far below XGBoost's 0.9979. This is exactly why
**PR-AUC, not accuracy or ROC-AUC, is the metric that matters under severe
class imbalance** — SGD's ROC-AUC (0.92) looks passable in isolation, but a
PR-AUC of 0.04 means it is effectively unusable at any reasonable precision
threshold, since nearly every transaction it flags as fraud would be a false
alarm. XGBoost is the only model that holds precision and recall together
(98.26% / 99.70%), which is why it was selected as the final model.

## Business Impact

- *High Fraud Detection Performance:* Achieved *99.7% fraud recall* with an *ROC-AUC of 0.9984*, enabling the system to identify nearly all fraudulent transactions while maintaining reliable classification performance on highly imbalanced financial data.

- *Minimal Customer Disruption:* Generated only *29 false positives* out of *552,439 legitimate transactions* (≈0.005% false positive rate), significantly reducing unnecessary transaction blocks and improving customer experience.

- *Behavior-Based Fraud Intelligence:* Engineered domain-specific financial features such as *sender balance inconsistency, account depletion, transaction-to-balance ratio, and destination balance availability*, allowing the model to detect suspicious transaction behavior instead of relying solely on transaction amount.

- *Production-Ready Decision Support:* Developed an *XGBoost-based fraud detection pipeline* capable of real-time risk scoring, helping financial institutions prioritize high-risk transactions, reduce manual investigation workload, and minimize potential financial losses.

## Roadmap — Toward a Full Fraud Detection Platform

The current repository covers model development and evaluation. The planned
next phase is to productionize this into a full system, targeting the
following architecture:

- *Serving* — FastAPI prediction service behind an API Gateway, with a
  Streamlit analyst dashboard for review and reporting
- *Explainability* — SHAP-based feature importance, waterfall/force plots
  surfaced alongside every prediction
- *Risk & decisioning* — a risk-scoring layer translating model probability
  into actions (approve / require OTP / manual review / block)
- *MLOps* — MLflow for experiment tracking, model versioning, and a model
  registry
- *Infrastructure* — Dockerized microservices deployed on AWS (ECS Fargate,
  RDS for prediction/audit history, S3 for artifacts), provisioned via
  Terraform
- *CI/CD* — GitHub Actions pipeline (lint, test, build, deploy) with health
  checks and smoke tests before production rollout
- *Security & auth* — JWT-based authentication with role-based access
  control (analyst / admin / auditor / developer roles), audit logging

This roadmap is aspirational and not yet implemented — it reflects the target
system design for future development, not the current state of the repo.
